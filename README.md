It's an implemention of SYNFlood based on raw-socket in Node.js.
<br/>
npm install synflood<br/>
npm link synflood<br/>
<br/>
synflood ip:port
<br/>
It doesn't work in windows,because windows forbids a raw-socket to write a raw TCP
packet but raw udp works well.<br/>
I tested that in Android it works well,too.But in every OS, you need root firstly.<br/>
